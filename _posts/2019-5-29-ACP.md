title: Automating Chart Population (ACP) in power point using a single excel file!

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/AcclaimedDarlingBull.gif)


Charts population is one of the main tasks for anyone using powerpoint.  

How do you go about populating the charts in a powerpoint.  

Step : 1 Go to the specific slide and then go to that chart and right click on the chart  
Step : 2 Click edit data to open back end excel for the chart  
Step : 3 Paste the data in the backend excel that gets opened    
Step : 4 Press shift+F9 and your data gets reflected in the chart   

Seems really easy right, but what if you have a 250 slides deck and say 100 charts in it. Then, seems a daunting task, isn't it.   Deck population easily takes a day to be done for 100 charts.  

What if you can provide all the data in a single excel in different sheets, and a python script copy pastes your data from your input excel to all the backend excels of the charts. That is what ACP does for you.  

You provide a single excel with data of each chart in a different sheet of the excel, naming each sheet in a convention such that the name is of the type - "slide number" + "\_" + "chart number".  

But, To input chart number, how will you get to know the order of the charts in a particular slide for multiple charts.
ACP helps you by providing a function- "Check order of multiple charts" for the same.  

So, how to go about using ACP :

Step : 1 Provide input for all charts in a separate input excel file. Make sure to name the sheets in the format specified above.

Step : 2 Put all ACP files, input excel file and ppt to be updated in a single folder.  

Step : 3 Run ACP.  

If you don't have python installed on your system, run exe file by double clicking it.  

If you have python installed, go to terminal and navigate to the folder, and run the script by typing the command -
python \<script name\>  

If you want to run the script through jupyter notebook, open the file in jupyter notebook and press "Run all" button at the top.

Step : 4 A UI opens after you run the script in step 3. Input your master excel name in first box, input the ppt name to be updated in second box, and input the name of the updated ppt that you want.  

Step : 5 Check the order of multiple charts in a slide by clicking the "Check order of multiple slides" button. Change the data provided in input excel in the order printed here.

If the data is provided in a different order, wrong data can be populated or an exception might occur.  

Step : 6 Click on "Update ppt" button to get updated ppt. The updated ppt gets stored in the same folder as created in step 2.    

Pay heed to the exception messages printed on the UI. They are important to catch which charts were not populated or encountered an error while populating. You would have to manually update those that resulted in an exception.
